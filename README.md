# Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project
This project builds and compares three machine learning models to predict Titanic passengers' survival based on features such as class, sex, and age. The script includes preprocessing, visualization, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and predictions on new data.

# Dataset
The code uses the Titanic dataset from the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Kaggle competition.
Required file: tested.csv

# Models Compared
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

#  How to Run
Set your local path in the variable "path"
Make sure tested.csv is in the correct folder.
Run the Python script.

# Classification performance metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
